# jet 🛩
It’s (j)ust (e)leventy and (t)ailwind … OK, and a few other things; it’s still *really* small though.

## Goal
While learning how to use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), I came across [a few starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) that combine it with Tailwind CSS, which is _neat_, but they also come with so much more.

Personally, I _only_ want Eleventy and Tailwind … and, taking the desire for simplicity one step further, I only want to use them via NPM scripts.

So, I made this and it seems to work 🤷‍♀️

## How you can use it
1. [Create your own new repo from jet’s template](https://github.com/marcamos/jet/generate), or [clone this one](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Start development: `npm run dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:8080 to see your work-in-progress
5. Do super-fun Eleventy and Tailwind things
6. When you’re done: `npm run build`
7. Host your project somewhere ([Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) are nice options)

That’s it 🕺

## A Note on Eleventy v3.x
**As of October 17th, 2024, jet has been updated to utilize Eleventy v3.x.** If you want to upgrade your project from Eleventy v2.x to v3.x, there’s a [a helper plugin](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-upgrade-help).

## A Note on Tailwind CSS v4.x
**As of January 31st, 2025, jet has been updated to utilize Tailwind CSS v4.0.** If you want to upgrade your project from Tailwind CSS v3.x to v4.x, the Tailwind folks have a _wonderful_ [Upgrade Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) you should review.

## Disclaimer
I _originally_ built this in about an hour through trial-and-error, so I'm sure there's _a lot_ of room for improvement.
